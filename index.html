  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
  <p>My name is Duane Rush and I am an aspiring software developer so that I can secure a job in the tech industry. I am origionally from Gig Harbor Washington and lived in California for ten years before moving back to Washington to attend college.</p>

  <p>I went to college at Central Washington University and got my bachelors degree in Cell and Molecular Biology. Upon graduating I went to work at Cordant Health Solutions as a lab technician and was there for almost three years. While there I realized I did not see a future in Biology and wanted to find a new path.</p>

  <p> One day my Grandfather was visiting and he mentioned a school he heard about on the radio called code fellows. Computers and the tech industry were something that had always interested me and my Grandpa believed this was my chance to take my life in a whole new direction so here I am.</p>
